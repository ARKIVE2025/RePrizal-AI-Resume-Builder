✨ What It Does

Most resume builders give you a pretty template and call it a day. RePrizal goes further — it **analyzes the actual job you're applying for** and tailors your resume content to match, giving you a real edge with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

Here's the workflow:

1. Import — Drop in your existing resume PDF and we'll extract all your information automatically using AI.

2. Target — Paste the job listing you're applying for. RePrizal analyzes the keywords and requirements that matter to that specific employer.

3. Export — Download a perfectly structured AI configuration file that generates a polished, ATS-optimized resume tailored to your target role.

🔄 How the AI Export Works

RePrizal doesn't generate your resume directly — it generates a **precision-crafted AI prompt** containing:

- Your complete structured work history
- Your education and skills
- The target job title and full job description
- Specific instructions for the AI to optimize keyword matching

You then paste this into **Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant** and get a professionally written, ATS-ready resume in seconds. Think of it as a bridge between your career history and the AI that writes your resume.
